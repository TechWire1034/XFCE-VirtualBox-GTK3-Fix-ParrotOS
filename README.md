# XFCE VirtualBox GTK3 Module Fix for Parrot OS

## Issue
When running **VirtualBox 7.1.8** on **Parrot OS (XFCE)**, the following warning appears in the terminal:

Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "xapp-gtk3-module"


## Cause
VirtualBox uses GTK3 for its user interface and attempts to load the `xapp-gtk3-module` for desktop integration (e.g., theming, window controls). Parrot OS, based on Debian, does not include this module in its default repositories, causing the harmless warning.

## Fix
Install the `libxapp-gtk3-module` package and its dependencies from the Debian repositories to eliminate the warning.

### Steps
1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install libxapp-gtk3-module libxapp1 xapps-common libgnomekbd-common libgnomekbd8

Verify the warning is gone by launching VirtualBox:
    
    virtualbox

Important Notes
The warning is harmless and does not affect VirtualBox functionality.

No additional VirtualBox components (e.g., Extension Pack) need reinstallation, as they are unrelated.

If the packages are unavailable in your Parrot OS repository, consider adding the Debian Sid repository temporarily or downloading .deb files from Debian Packages.
